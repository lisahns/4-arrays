//next step: put onclick event on button, and excetue function depending on which radiobutton is selected
//put onclick event on button
//if condition, to which radiobutton is selected



//The input should be given in the first input box as a string. 
//The user should be able to enter numbers, separated by commas. 
//In JavaScript, youâ€™ll convert this string to an array of numbers.

//Based on which radio button is selected, choose which function to run. 
//Pass an array as an argument to the particular function.

//Finally, return the result from the function and display it on the page.




//Add CSS to give the user an intuitive experience

//Think about and constrain what inputs can be given. 
//The user may be inconsistent in the string they give, for example using spaces or not. 
//How can we account for this, in JavaScript or HTML?
